i used to play all sports from the school days , after joining college i didn't play much. after a while my college conducted a kabaddi tournament. I participated in it with a heavy training but anyhow the opponents were bulky i got caught by the and 3 of them fell at me and my right leg got a acl ligament tear. from that incident i became a one_leged man
